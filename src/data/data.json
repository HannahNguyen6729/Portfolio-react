    "story": "I was born and raised in Vietnam. I graduated a university in my country in 2014. When I was working in Vietnam, I met some people studying abroad and told me about their adventures. From that, I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and see the world. I came to Finland on my own as a student again. I was studying and working at the same time and started my in-depth front-end programming journey. Since then, I have made a lot of projects, from basic HTML pages to complex projects like a React library. I hope to be a great fullstack developer and get my dream job in the future.",
    "intro": "Besides coding, I also like to read blogs, anime and listen to music. My favorite animes are Naruto Uzumaki, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, InuYasha: Dog Demon and so on.",
